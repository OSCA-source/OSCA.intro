Description: 
    Deploys the introduction to the "Orchestrating Single Cell Analysis with Bioconductor" book.
    This describes how to install R and Bioconductor packages, links out to some resources to learn R,
    describes how to load datasets into an R session, provides an overview of the SingleCellExperiment class,
    and performs a "quick start" demonstration for basic single-cell RNA-seq analyses. It is intended for
    readers with little-to-no computational background who are just getting started with analyses in R.
